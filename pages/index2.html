<h3> More Info Abt Me</h3>
	<p> I love to be outside. I enjoy swimming in the river, kayaking, hiking, camping, and laying in my hamock, but I am not a fan of the bugs that like to swarm your face while doing those activities. I have several houseplants in my room and enjoy gardening in the spring and summertime. I have also just recently gotten into sewing, thanks to my mom for getting me a sewing machine for Christmas. I also play some video games, I am not the best at them. The only game I am even remotely good at is Minecraft, but would fail miserably if I had to play hardcore mode. My favorite TV show is probably Psych, I also really enjoy Dexter and The Magicians. I do have other favorites but they're not even worth mentioning because they have been cancelled. An intresting fact about me is I have never broken a bone, even though I am an insanely clumsy person. </p>
